Subject: Mexican Trout Project - Data Analysis Complete & Implementation Plan Ready

Dear Dean,

Thank you for the comprehensive overview of the Mexican Trout project and the challenges with the discontinued Drupal system. I've completed a thorough analysis of your Excel database and developed a detailed implementation plan for creating a modern web-based system to replace the British Museum's Scratchpads platform.

## Key Findings from Data Analysis

Your database contains 350 Mexican trout occurrence records spanning from 1903 to 2014, with 281 records having geographic coordinates. The data covers 15 distinct trout taxa across 17 major river basins in 9 Mexican states. The most sampled areas are the Yaqui (78 records) and Fuerte (49 records) basins, which aligns with your research focus.

## Proposed Technical Solution

I've designed a modern web platform that addresses all the requirements you outlined:

**Core Features:**
- PostgreSQL/PostGIS database with full spatial capabilities
- Interactive mapping interface with multiple hydrographic layers
- Version-controlled data management system
- Admin interface for continuous updates
- Public-facing species information pages
- API for data access and integration

**GIS Integration:**
- Primary integration with SIATL (Mexican National Hydrography System)
- Comparison tools for Hydrosheds, GIRES, and INEGI DEM datasets
- Spatial analysis capabilities for watershed delineation
- Tools to identify and resolve hydrographic data conflicts

**Data Management:**
- Automated data validation and cleaning pipeline
- Version control for all data changes
- Integration with genetic data from Abadia et al. (2015)
- Framework for linking Casey's morphometric data
- Conservation status integration with IUCN assessments

## Implementation Timeline

The project can be completed in 11 weeks across 5 phases:
- Phase 1 (2 weeks): Data foundation and schema design
- Phase 2 (3 weeks): Core database and web application
- Phase 3 (3 weeks): GIS integration and advanced features
- Phase 4 (2 weeks): Conservation integration and optimization
- Phase 5 (1 week): Deployment and data migration

## Benefits Over Current Situation

This solution will:
- Replace the discontinued Drupal system with a modern, maintainable platform
- Enable continuous data updates and quality control
- Provide advanced GIS analysis tools for hydrographic comparisons
- Create a public outreach platform for conservation education
- Support ongoing research with genetic and morphological data integration

## Next Steps

I'm ready to begin implementation once you review and approve the plan. The system will be designed to accommodate your team's workflow and can be customized based on your specific needs.

Please let me know if you'd like to discuss any aspects of the plan or if you have questions about the technical approach. I'm also available to walk through the data analysis results and demonstrate the interactive mapping capabilities.

Best regards,
Varun
